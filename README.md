# data_analysis_with_python
Here I have worked with automobile data. This is the basic course in data analysis. Here I have learned the following:

1. Importing and exporting data
2. Data wrangling or Data cleaning : identify and handle missing values, Data formatting, Incorrect data types, Data Normalization, Data Bining , and categorical values to quantitative variables (dummy variables)
3. Exploratory data analysis: In here, we summarize the main data to get a better understanding, uncover relationships between variables and extract important variables.
4. Model development: Train and predict three types of models, evaluating them by R-squared and MSE: 
     I. Simple Linear Regression Model
     II. Multiple Linear Regression Model
     III. Polynomial Regression model and Pipelines
5. Model Evaluation and Refinement:
